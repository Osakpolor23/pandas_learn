# Python Pandas: The Ultimate Guide for Beginners

## Introduction
Pandas is a powerful and widely used data manipulation Python package for working with tabular data i.e. data organized in rows and columns, also known as DataFrames.

pandasâ€™ functionality includes data transformations, like sorting rows and taking subsets, to calculating summary statistics such as the mean, reshaping DataFrames, and joining DataFrames together. pandas works well with other popular Python data science packages, often called the PyData ecosystem, including:

- NumPy for numerical computing.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and other data visualization packages.
- scikit-learn for machine learning.

Here, I walked through various activities and workflows using pandas to manipulate and analyze data effectively so as to fully get a grasp of its capabilities.
